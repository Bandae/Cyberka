# A movie rating website made with django

Will feature a database of movies, which users can review and rate. Reviews can be commented and up/downvoted. The site's intended use is for closed groups to rate and compare movies they have watched.

## Features to be implemented:  
- web scraping to make addding movies to the database easier.

- user profiles with statistics (such as the average rating, total up/downvote balance of all reviews, all watched movies etc.)

- user roles, to limit who can manage the movies in the database

- *more to be added*
## Initial design:
### Main page:
![main page](./additional_resources/Main_page.svg)

### After opening a movie's page:
![movie page](./additional_resources/Movie_page.svg)
